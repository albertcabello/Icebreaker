# Icebreaker
App to show users near them and their preferences


After two months of work and a deleted repository, I'm proud to say, that this app is fundamentally complete.  Currently, the map displays users that are within one square mile of the logged in user.  The only parts missing are a menu for entering user interests and updating current location.  

# How to Use the Demo
After moving the SQL database to my website, this demo is now able to be run from anywhere.  Just download this app and click run.
