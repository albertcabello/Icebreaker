App to show users near them and their preferences


After two months of work and a deleted repository, I'm proud to say, that this app is almost fundamentally complete.  Currently, the map displays users that are nearby the logged in user.  The only parts missing are a menu for entering user interests and updating current location.  The API needs work so instead of displaying people that are within 10% of a users coordinates, it shows people within a mile.
