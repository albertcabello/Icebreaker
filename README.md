# Icebreaker
App to show users near them and their preferences


After two months of work and a deleted repository, I'm proud to say, that this app is fundamentally complete.  Currently, the map displays users that are within one square mile of the logged in user.  The only parts missing are a menu for entering user interests and updating current location.  

# How to Use the Demo
Go to https://github.com/albertcabello/Icebreaker-API and clone the repository.  Follow the directions on that repository to set up MySQL.  Once that is done, run the index.php file, and run the iOS app, everything should function perfectly.
